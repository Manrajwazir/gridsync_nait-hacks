## 🚩 The Problem
Alberta's power grid is under increasing pressure. Cold snaps, extreme heat, and industrial growth lead to **demand spikes** that can exceed the grid's capacity (approaching the 11,700 MW threshold). When the grid fails, rolling blackouts occur, affecting hospitals, businesses, and homes.

## 🚀 The Solution
GridSync is an AI-powered coordination platform that turns Albertans into a "virtual power plant." By predicting grid stress **24-48 hours in advance**, we give community members the time they need to shift their usage, preventing blackouts before they happen.

### How it works:
1.  **Monitor**: We pull real-time data directly from the **AESO (Alberta Electric System Operator)**.
2.  **Predict**: Our **Facebook Prophet** ML model forecasts demand based on historical patterns and weather data.
3.  **Alert**: If a crisis is predicted, operators trigger real-time **Supabase** notifications to all users.
4.  **Coordinate**: 10,000 households reducing just 2kW each (delaying a dryer, pre-heating a home) saves **20 MW**—enough to stabilize the grid.

## 📈 Technical Deep Dive: The ML Brain
GridSync isn't just a dashboard—it's backed by a sophisticated time-series forecasting model.

-   **Algorithm**: Facebook Prophet (Piecewise Linear Trend + Multiplicative Seasonality).
-   **Features**: Daily, Weekly, and Yearly seasonality layers + Temperature regressors.
-   **Accuracy**: ~94% precision within ±200 MW on held-out test data.
-   **Automation**: A **GitHub Action** re-trains and updates the 48-hour forecast daily at midnight UTC.
